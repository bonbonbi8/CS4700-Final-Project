# Challenges & Fixes
The biggest challenge with this project was just the sheer amount we had to learn. Unity is very confusing and finicky, especially for students like us who have zero prior experience with game dev in general. It took a ton of researching, guides, and asking for help to get basic things working.
This monumental challenge, on top of the fact that we both have 3 other courses as well as responsibiliies outside of education, left us without enough time to fully complete the product. 
Considering these roadblocks, I believe we delivered a decent end product.
